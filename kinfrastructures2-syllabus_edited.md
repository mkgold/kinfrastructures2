# Course Description

Infrastructure is all around us, rarely remarked upon. Indeed, the latent state of infrastructure is part of what marks it as such; as Susan Leigh Starr has noted, infrastructure studies involves the study of "boring things."

This class will explore the emerging nexus of critical infrastructure studies and critical university studies, focusing on how they can be combined with digital humanities approaches to explore the infrastructure of scholarly knowledge. From our libraries to our journals to our conferences to our operating systems to our use of social media, scholars communicate through an entanglement of corporate and commercial interests. Beyond the obviously problematic commercial infrastructures built by predatory publishers and corporate conglomerates such as Elsevier, scholars routinely depend on for-profit publication venues and commercial journals to disseminate their work, and often use enterprise online platforms to teach their classes.

As a set of alternatives to the commercialized infrastructure of knowledge dissemination in the academy, the course will consider open access publication models, free software development, and university press publishing. Even as we explore such alternatives, we will critique them, considering the ways that such alternatives themselves depend upon commercial technical stacks, and considering whether these alternatives are equally available and accessible across the globe.

Topics to be explored include: introductions to critical infrastructure studies and critical university studies; the environmental impact of the cloud; the free software movement; academic publishing models; constructing open platforms. Students in the class will explore publishing platforms collaboratively created by CUNY and other partners, including the CUNY Academic Commons and Manifold, as well as others such as Humanities Commons and Zotero. The goal of the class, in the end, is to ask students to consider how and where their own scholarly knowledge is distributed, by whom, and under what terms.

# Learning Objectives

* Explore and become familiar with the fields of critical infrastructure studies, digital humanities, and critical university studies

* Become more aware of the knowledge systems and infrastructures we participate in

* Consider the materiality of technical infrastructure and its entanglements in social, political, and interpersonal contexts

* Make a collective intervention into the knowledge infrastructure of The Graduate Center and/or CUNY

* Devote time and space to reading, thinking, and writing

# Student Disability Services
It is Graduate Center and CUNY policy to provide appropriate accommodations to students with disabilities. Any student with a disability who may need accommodations in this class is advised to speak directly to the manager of [Student Disability Services](http://cuny.is/disabilityservices), located in Student Affairs, room 7301, or call 212-817-7400 as early in the semester as possible. All discussions will remain confidential.

# Requirements and Assignments

## Weekly Reading and Discussion:
Students should complete all weekly readings in advance of the class meeting and should take an active part in class discussions.

## Blog Posts and Class Discussions
Each week, one student will write a response to the assigned readings, to be posted by Sunday morning the day before the class in which those readings will be discussed. These posts should offer a brief 1-2 paragraph response to the course texts and then should provide a set of 4-5 questions for group discussion. The post may also provide links to relevant related readings and resources. In class that day, that student will frame and initiate our discussion in class that week. [Sign up for slots here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/4090E4AAFA929A46-knowledge1).

Other assignments should be posted to the blog as suggested below. Generally, we should try to use our course blog as a way to share information with each other and anyone else following the course from afar. Students who prefer to post privately may use our agreed-upon password to protect their posts.

## Personal Narrative
Write a short (~500 word) blog post about some aspect of your personal knowledge infrastructure. You might think about how you keep track of citations, how you take notes, how you store/annotate academic articles, how you access academic texts, what systems you use to write, which platforms you use to search for academic articles, how you find new work in your field. In your post, do some work to extend your knowledge of the infrastructure surrounding your topic/tool/platform and reflect a bit on your choices. What systems does your chosen method rely upon? What aspects are you in control of, and what are you not? What alternatives exist, and why might or might not you want to consider them? 

## Trace a Knowledge Infrastructure
In the spirit of Miriam Posner's explorations of the infrastructure of the supply chain, document the material basis of a knowledge infrastructure of some kind. You might explore, for instance, a journal in your field. Who publishes it? What publication platform is used to publish the work? Who owns the systems of distribution? What agreements are formed between the publisher and universities to provide access to the publication? What kinds of legal contracts or agreements can you unearth? What kind of labor is involved in the production of the journal? Similar analysis might be performed on learning management systems, university-procured services and contracts, and buildings and spaces. To complete the assignment, please post a short (~500-750 word) blog post and make an informal presentation on your topic to the class

## Collective Intervention in GC/CUNY Knowledge Infrastructures (Final Project)
Through class discussions, we will come to a consensus on an intervention that we will collectively make into the knowledge infrastructures at the GC or in CUNY.

Students should complete a 500-word reflection on the collective intervention, to be posted on the course blog, due December 15.

# Grading
Regular participation in our class discussions and online spaces is expected and essential. All students will receive a grade of A for completing the assignments associated with their differential credit requirements. Students who are unable to complete assignments associated with differential credit requirements should write a short self-assessment, to be shared with me, explaining the grade they would like to receive for this course. For more on this grading policy, please see recent work on the topic of [ungrading](https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/blog/2022/09/what-is-ungrading/).

Differential Credit Requirements:
* 2 credits: 1 discussion lead + all assignments except Personal Narrative and Trace a Knowledge Infrastructure
* 3 credits: 1 discussion lead + all assignments except Trace a Knowledge Infrastructure
* 4 credits: 2 discussion leads + all assignments
